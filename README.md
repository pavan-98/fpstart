Fingerprint Bike Ignition Using Arduino Uno 


This Fingerprint Bike Ignition Offers a More Robust Solution to On-going Bike Thefts , while a Key of a Bike can Easily be Copied , a Fingerprint is more Secure , with the given code files one can easily Regiser their Fingerprints and Attach the Sensor Directly to the Bike Itself.

#### This Project uses Arduino Uno , 5V Relay , R307 FingerPrint Sensor all the Links are Given Below

#### Pin Diagram :

FROM FP Sensor to Arduino : Black->GND , White->Pin3 , Green->Pin2 , Red->3.3V.

From Relay to Arduino : Input->Pin8 , Gnd->Gnd , VCC->5V.

The Ignition Switch Wires go to the Open Circuit of the Relay.

#### Youtube Video Demonstrating the Same Will Be Uploaded Soon.
